    "# The basics of the Python language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular general purpose, free language. As opposed to other systems that are focused towards a particular task (e.g. R for statistics), Python has a strong following on the web, on systems operations and in data analysis. For scientific computing, a large number of useful add-ons (\"libraries\") are available to help you analyse and process data. This is an invaluable resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being free, Python is also very portable, and easy to pick up. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Launching Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the Jupyter (or IPython) notebook for you to interact with Python through the browser. There are ways, but the notebook has proved to be quite good for data analysis and mixing code and the logic behind it. To launch the notebook, go into a shell and type\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will open a new tab in the browser (or launch a browser if you haven't got one opened) with the Jupyter file selector. Through this, you can navigate through the file system, and select an existing notebook or create a new one. For this\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We recommend that you open the course notebooks and save a copy of them under a different name (`File->Make a copy`) and that you edit and modify that copy rather than the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter notebook allows you to either enter Python code (dropdown says `Code`), or text using the [markdown standard](http://datascience.ibm.com/blog/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet/) (dropdown says `Markdown`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computer programs\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see a computer as a machine that stores some form of \"data\" and does operations on these data using a set of actions (e.g. a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), if you can stomach lots of irrelevant detail!). This set of actions is  called *a program* (or *script*). A program basically lists a set of transformation on data. These can include arithmetic operations, working with text, interacting with the network, etc. But a critical point of all this is *data*, and we will see how to Python deals with data first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Different pieces of information are stored differently. A *data type* describes how data are described. In Python, there is no need to define the data type, as Python will inspect the data and decide on the best data type to use. Perhaps the simplest data types are those related to storing numbers, let's see them...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers and Floating point numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 456778, -478576, ... They're different from floating point numbers such as 1.8, -2.35, 1.78456e34, 1.78456e-34. Computers store integers in base 2 (binary numbers), so that a number like 10235 can be written as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "10235 &= 1\\cdot 2^{12}+0\\cdot 2^{12}+0\\cdot 2^{11}+1\\cdot 2^{10}+1\\cdot 2^{9}+ \\\\\n",
    "&\\,1\\cdot 2^{8}+1\\cdot 2^{7}+1\\cdot 2^{6}+1\\cdot 2^{5}+1\\cdot 2^{4}+1\\cdot 2^{3}+0\\cdot 2^{2}+1\\cdot 2^{1}+1\\cdot 2^{0}.\\\\\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that to fit 10235, we need 13 \"boxes\" that can be set to either 0 or 1. These boxes are usually called *bits*, and 8 bits are assumed to be one byte. We note that it is often the case that one bit position might be used to indicate the sign of the number. In Python 2.7,  most integers are either 4 or 8 bytes (the second option is the most popular one), depending on your Python build. If we use an 8 byte storage, that means we are using 64 bits, and thus the maximum integer would be $2^{63}-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers are real numbers. Computers store them as [floating points](http://floating-point-gui.de/). In this convention, the computer basically stores a number like 2.35 as $235\\times 10^{-3}$, or as a base and an exponent. The base can be stored as for integers, and the exponent as an additional integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use numbers and operate with them as you'd expect with the symbols `+, -, *, /, %` and `//`:"

To do this, we would need to be able to repeat some actions varying some parameters, and we would need to be able to control the flow of things by checking some conditions.
